title: "macOS Cocoa Phase Out"
---
We now have working macOS versions of dupeGuru built with both UI toolkits and supporting both 
Intel and M1 chips.  The latest downloads are as follows (see details below for more information):
- Qt Version [https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru/releases/download/4.2.0/dupeguru_macOS_Qt_4.2.0.zip](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru/releases/download/4.2.0/dupeguru_macOS_Qt_4.2.0.zip)
- Cocoa Version [https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru/releases/download/4.2.0/dupeguru_macOS_Cocoa_4.2.0.dmg](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru/releases/download/4.2.0/dupeguru_macOS_Cocoa_4.2.0.dmg)

## History & Cocoa Phase Out
Most of the history is detailed in [macOS Releases Going Forward]({% post_url 2021-08-14-macOS_releases_going_forward %}) and [macOS Version Notes]({% post_url 2021-03-09-macOS_version_notes %})
With the current development mainly focusing on the Qt version for new features and improvements, the Cocoa UI version will no longer be updated with the next minor release.
